# Project Lambda


Project Lambda is a project made by 3 Western University students in Western AI. 

We are creating an AI bot to play Counter Strike: Global Offensive.

Currently we are training a a yolov7 model on a custom dataset using transfer learning.

Our dataset consists of 6000 screenshots of CS:GO gameplay collected and labelled by us.

Our next goal will be to train the movement bot using OpenAI Gym and various different CNN (convolutional neural network) algorithms.

We hope present at our project at the CUCAI conference in 2023.
