# Project Lambda

This project consists of two AI agents built to play
the first-person shooter video game ”Counter-Strike: Global
Offensive” (CS:GO). The first agent uses a combination of
YOLOv7 object detection and A* pathfinding algorithm. The
second agent uses a deep neural network trained on a large
data set of video footage of professional CS:GO matches using
behavioural cloning and offline reinforcement learning. While
most ”aim-bot” programs tap into the games memory to retrieve
information such as the coordinates of players and aim the mouse
directly at them, the goal for our project was to create an AI that
can match the performance and behaviour of real players while
relying purely on the visuals on the screen. We look to compare
the behaviour and realism of an AI built with pathfinding vs an
AI built with machine learning.
